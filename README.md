# Android App


## How to build
    ./gradlew build

### Firebase Config
This app is using Firebase, hence to build it a _google-services.json_ is needed.

This file contains sensitive data and we can't keep it in the repo if you want to contribute please contact us.

An encrypted version of _google-services.json_ is added in the repo, in this way Travis can build the app for continuous integration.
